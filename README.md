## **Flask Application Design**

### **HTML Files**

- **index.html:**
    - This is the main HTML file that will be displayed when the user accesses the root URL '/'.
    - It should contain the necessary HTML elements, such as forms, buttons, and text fields, to allow the user to interact with the application.

- **results.html:**
    - This HTML file will be displayed after the user submits the form on the index.html page.
    - It should display the results of the user's input, such as the predicted destination or directions.

### **Routes**

- **@app.route('/')**
    - This route serves the 'index.html' file when the user accesses the root URL '/'.

- **@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])**
    - This route handles the form submission from the 'index.html' page.
    - It extracts the user's input from the form data and uses the 'predict_destination' function to predict the destination.
    - Once the destination is predicted, it renders the 'results.html' page with the predicted destination.

- **@app.route('/directions', methods=['POST'])**
    - This route handles the form submission from the 'results.html' page.
    - It extracts the user's input from the form data and uses the 'calculate_directions' function to calculate the directions to the predicted destination.
    - Once the directions are calculated, it renders the 'results.html' page with the calculated directions.

### **Helper Functions**

- **predict_destination(user_input):**
    - This function takes the user's input and predicts the destination based on some complex logic or AI algorithm.
    - It returns the predicted destination as a string.

- **calculate_directions(destination):**
    - This function takes the predicted destination and calculates the directions to that destination.
    - It returns the directions as a list of instructions.
